DESCRIPTION
===========

This directory contains programmes using the C<Arithmetic::PaperAndPencil> module,
beyond the simple display of a single operation.

PROGRAMMES
==========

F<comparison-Newton-gallows.raku>

This programme  computes √2 using  the Newton method. There  are three
functions, one using  C<Rat> numbers, the second  using C<Num> numbers
and the  last using  C<Arithmetic::PaperAndPencil>. A  fourth function
computes  √2  using   C<Arithmetic::PaperAndPencil>  with  the  direct
"gallows" method.

F<conv-pi.raku>

This programme converts π (with up to 50 decimal digits) from radix 10
to another radix.
