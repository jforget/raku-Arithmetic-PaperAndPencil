DESCRIPTION
===========

This directory contains programmes using the `Arithmetic::PaperAndPencil` module,
beyond the simple display of a single operation.

PROGRAMMES
==========

* `comparison-Newton-gallows.raku`

This programme  computes √2 using  the Newton method. There  are three
functions, one using  `Rat` numbers, the second  using `Num` numbers
and the  last using  `Arithmetic::PaperAndPencil`. A  fourth function
computes  √2  using   `Arithmetic::PaperAndPencil`  with  the  direct
"gallows" method.

* `conv-pi.raku`

This programme converts π (with up to 50 decimal digits) from radix 10
to another radix.
